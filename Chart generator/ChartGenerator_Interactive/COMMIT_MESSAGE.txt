fix: Resolve crosshair tool causing chart preview changes and redraw issues

- Fixed multiple indentation errors in chart_generator.py that were causing syntax errors
- Enhanced crosshair event handler validation to prevent interference with chart preview
- Added axis tracking (crosshair_ax) to ensure crosshair events only trigger for correct axis
- Improved error handling in crosshair enable/disable methods with try-catch blocks
- Changed from canvas.draw() to canvas.draw_idle() for better performance and reduced blocking
- Enhanced cleanup sequence in _cleanup_chart_elements() with forced cleanup fallback
- Added null data validation before updating crosshair position to prevent crashes
- Improved event handler disconnection with robust error handling in _disable_crosshair()

The crosshair tool now works smoothly without causing unwanted chart preview changes,
redraw issues, or performance problems. All syntax errors have been resolved and the
application imports and runs successfully.
