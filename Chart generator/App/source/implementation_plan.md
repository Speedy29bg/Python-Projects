# Chart Generator Restructuring Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to replace the original monolithic `ChartGenerator.py` 
file with the new modularized version.

## Step 1: Backup Original Files

Before making any changes to the production environment, backup the original files:

```
cp ChartGenerator.py ChartGenerator.py.bak
```

## Step 2: Verify All Features Are Implemented

Verify that all features from the original implementation are present in the new modular version:

- [x] CSV file loading and parsing
- [x] Data analysis functionality
- [x] Chart generation and customization
- [x] Excel export functionality
- [x] PNG/PDF export functionality
- [x] UI components and interactivity
- [x] Error handling and logging

## Step 3: Testing

Run the following tests on both versions and compare results:

1. Loading different CSV file formats
2. Generating charts with various options
3. Exporting to different formats
4. Testing error handling with invalid inputs

## Step 4: Replace Implementation

Three implementation options:

### Option A: Full Replacement
1. Rename `ChartGenerator_new.py` to `ChartGenerator.py` (replacing the original)
2. Keep all module files in place

### Option B: Gradual Transition
1. Keep both implementations temporarily
2. Update documentation to direct users to the new implementation
3. Set up deprecation warnings in the old implementation
4. Replace fully after a transition period

### Option C: Versioned Implementation
1. Rename `ChartGenerator_new.py` to `ChartGenerator2.py`
2. Keep original for backward compatibility
3. Default to new implementation in entry points

## Step 5: Update Documentation

Update documentation to reflect the new modular structure:

1. Update any references to the file structure
2. Add module-specific documentation 
3. Create API documentation for new modules

## Step 6: Post-Implementation Monitoring

Monitor for any issues after deployment:

1. Check for any new errors in logs
2. Monitor performance characteristics
3. Collect user feedback

## Recommendation

Proceed with Option A (Full Replacement) after thorough testing, as the new implementation maintains all functionality while offering improved maintainability.
